# CompositionalLayoutDemo
A small demo project to gauge the benefits of UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout. 

Primary focus of demo was testing vertical lists with horizontally scrollable sections. 

All collection based view controllers are built with a single UICollectionView, using UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource.
